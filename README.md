# Project Proposal.

## Weather App.

For my project proposal I would like to create a Weather Web App. The user will be able to type in a city of their choosing and the current with a 5 day forecast on that location. I plan on using either using accuweather or darksky API to get the data for the weather.  

### Other features

- Have the option to view temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
- Save inputted location.
